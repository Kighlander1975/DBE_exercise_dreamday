# DBE_exercise_dreamday
## My interpretation of the exercise "Build the Dreamday" Website
### Introducing
This project is part of my continuing education, where I'm practicing web development skills. I'm using it as an opportunity to document my workflow with GIT, showing the step-by-step progress of building a "Dreamday" website. The project includes image research to find appropriate visuals that match the theme. From a technical perspective, I'm implementing Flexbox for responsive layouts and proper positioning of elements. This exercise helps me improve both my coding skills and project documentation practices.

### First steps
First, I worked on a basic CSS structure, as I use in all my projects.
This CSS is also composed of several parts:
- Base CSS settings
- Site CSS settings

In the base settings, the required fonts are first integrated, of course DSGVO (EU: GDPR) compliant. The colors to be used are also defined as variables, and basic tags are preformatted (such as the &lt;h&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; tags, etc.). A CSS reset completes the base settings file.

Next, I create my completely empty HTML framework, where I simply include the CSS file and define a title. This completes my preparations.

### HTML structure
I have a PDF file in which, similar to Figma, the page has been completely designed. Based on this PDF, I create a basic HTML structure that includes all the elements that appear on the page. From the navigation bar, the hero area, the individual sections and articles, to the footer.
If possible, I use ABSOLUTELY no additional CSS up to this point other than what's currently in the base settings.
